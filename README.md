# Concentration Game

The game "Concentration" is a memory game that requires  
the player to flip over two cards to look for matches.  
If the cards don't match they are flipped back face down.  
The player wins if all matches are found on the board.  

The game uses a standard deck of playing cards, 52 cards,  
as the cards for the game. To get a match two cards of the  
same face value need to paired. Ex. a queen of diamonds and  
a queen of hearts, an 8 of clubs and an 8 of spades.
